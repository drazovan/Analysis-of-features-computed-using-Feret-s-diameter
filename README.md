### Feret's diameter
Feret's diameter of an object is the distance between its two furthest points measured in a given direction. For an illustration, we give the following image:

When computed for multiple directions, Feret's diameter enables a number of other shape descriptors. For this study we choose the following:
1. *Maximal Feret's diameter* - equal to the classic diameter, i.e. the distance between two futhest points of an object. We compute it as the maximal Feret's diameter over all the directions.
2. *Minimal Feret's diameter* - minimal Feret's diameter over all the directions.
3. *Aspect ratio* - ratio between maximla and minimal Feret's diameter.
4. *Average Feret's diameter* - average Feret's diameter over all the directions.
5. *Feret's diameter perpendicular to the maximal*.
6. *Feret's diameter perpendicular to the minimal*.
7. *Area of the minimal encasing rectangle* - the area of the rectangle with minimal area among all the rectangles that encase the object.
8. *Larger side of the minimal encasing rectangle*.
9. *Shorter side of the minimal encasing rectangle*.
10. *The radius of the ball with equal volume as the cylinder with radius equal to minimal Feret's diameter and height equal to maximal Feret's diameter*.
11. *Perimeter* - computed as the average Feret's diameter over all directions multiplied by $\pi$.
